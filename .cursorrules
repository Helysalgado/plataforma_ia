- Follow AGENTS.md as the source of truth.
- Work in phases: Audit -> Refine -> Design -> Tests -> Implementation -> Delivery.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask questions (max 7) and stop.
- Update docs in /docs before coding when behavior changes.
- Always add tests for new behavior.
- Use diagrams-as-code (Mermaid or PlantUML) and keep them updated.
- Never commit secrets; use env vars.
- Maintain /docs/ai/AI_USAGE_LOG.md with prompts and human edits.
- Backlog: /docs/product/EPICS_AND_STORIES.md
- Tickets + estados: GitHub Issues/Projects ONLY (no states in Markdown)
- Enforce IDs: EPIC/US/T/ADR/ENT/API/UT/IT/BDD/E2E
- Every commit/PR references T-xxx; every T-xxx references US-xx
- No implementation without US + T + acceptance criteria
