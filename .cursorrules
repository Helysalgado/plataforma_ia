- Follow AGENTS.md as the source of truth.
- Work in phases: Audit -> Refine -> Design -> Tests -> Implementation -> Delivery.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask questions (max 7) and stop.
- Update docs in /docs before coding when behavior changes.
- Always add tests for new behavior.
- Use diagrams-as-code (Mermaid or PlantUML) and keep them updated.
- Never commit secrets; use env vars.
- Maintain /docs/ai/AI_USAGE_LOG.md with prompts and human edits.
